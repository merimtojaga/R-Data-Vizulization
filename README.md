# Data Visualization - INSH 5302 - 12/07/24

The Goal of this visualization was to create an infographic using the EV built in data
set from R. This was meant to showcase my experience in creating visuals through R. 
The Final project of my Information and Design course.

## Description

Everything from selected data to color scheme was implemented based on the practices 
learned throughout the course of INSH 5302. It creates a compeling storyline that 
does not require the user to have any previous knowledge on R, the data set, or any 
real background on EVs. I shared an Rstudio RMD file, a html, and finally a PDF of 
the infographic.
